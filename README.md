# NLP-Yelp-Classification
- A project for users and businesses to gain insights from reviews using Unsupervised Learning and NLP
- Sentiment analysis and prediction of review ratings on the Yelp reviews dataset was created using various machine learning algorithms. 
- Jupiter notebook was used with many models for better analysis and identification of links between reviews and ratings.
- The dataset is a CSV file that consisted of 10 columns and almost 10,000 records dating between 2005 and 2013.
- Variables consisting of the business id, the date, the review type, the review, the starts, and the tag description of the review in the historical setting that notes whether it was cool, useful, or funny. A correlation analysis was done in order to track any link between the voting columns or between the number of stars and the review itself.
